1. **Extreme Value Theorem** (**EVT**)
   Let $f$ be a continuous function over a closed interval $[a,b].$ Then there exists a point in the interval where $f$ has a maximum, and there exists a point in the interval where $f$​ has a minimum. 

   *Proof:* Real numbers. $\varepsilon$-$\delta.$​ 

   

2. **Intermediate Value Theorem** (**IVT**)
   Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b].$ Let $\alpha = f(a)$ and $\beta = f(b).$ Let $\gamma$ be a number between $\alpha$ and $\beta.$  Then $\exists c \in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) = \gamma.$

   *Proof:* Real numbers. $\varepsilon$-$\delta.$

   

3. **Fermat's Theorem**
   Let $f$ be a function which is defined and differentiable in the open interval $(a,b).$ Let $c$ be a number in the interval at which the function has a local maximum or a local minimum. Then $f'(c) = 0.$ 

   *Proof:* From definition of local extremum and definition of derivative.

  > The following theorem, which shows that there is only one order complete extension field of $\mathbb{Q}$​, is the most fundamental result of analysis and the starting point for all research into the ‘limiting processes’ which are at the center of all analytic investigation.

  > **Theorem** There is, up to isomorphism, a unique order complete extension field $\mathbb{R}$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. This extension is called the field of real numbers.
