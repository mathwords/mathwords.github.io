1. **Extreme Value Theorem** (**EVT**)
   Let $f$ be a continuous function over a closed interval $[a,b].$ Then there exists a point in the interval where $f$ has a maximum, and there exists a point in the interval where $f$ has a minimum. 

   

2. **Intermediate Value Theorem** (**IVT**)
   Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b].$ Let $\alpha = f(a)$ and $\beta = f(b).$ Let $\gamma$ be a number between $\alpha$ and $\beta.$  Then $\exists c \in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) = \gamma.$
