***Exercise 1***

We will prove that $f_* : X/\!\! \sim \, \to Y/ \dot\sim$ defined by $f_*([x]) = [f(x)]$ is the function that fulfils the required conditions. 

* Indeed, $(p_Y \circ f)(x)$ $=$ $(p_Y(f(x)))$ $=$ $[f(x)].$ Whereas, $(f_* \circ p_X)(x)$ $=$ $f_* (p_X(x))$ $=$ $f_*([x])$ $=$ $[f(x)].$ Thus, $f_* \circ p_X = p_Y \circ f$ and consequently the given diagram is commutative. 
* Furthermore the function $f_*$ is unique, because if $g$ is another function that fulfils the required condition, then we require that $g \circ p_X = p_Y \circ f,$ that is, $g(p_X(x)) = [f(x)].$ But $p_X(x) = [x],$ and $[f(x)] = $ $f_*([x]).$ Hence, $g([x]) = $ $f_*([x]).$ We therefore have, $g = f_*$ so that $f_*$ is unique.
