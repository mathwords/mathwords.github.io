**ERRATA**

1. p.20 Missing sentence in proposition 3.8. Add:

   > **3.8 Proposition**    Let $f:X \to Y$ be a function. The following...

2. p.21 Missing space in Exercise 3(b). Insert space:

   > $f$ is injective... 

3. p.21 Mismatch of left and right parentheses size in Exercise 4(b). 

4. p.46 The definition of finite set in para-2 seems awkwardly phrased. Rephrase as:

   > A set $X$ is called **finite**, if $X$ is empty, or if there exists a bijection from $\{1,...,n\}$ to $X$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}.$

**OBSERVATIONS**

1. **I.1** p.7 
   The answer to **Exercise 2** remains unchanged if the first sentence is deleted. Although keeping the problem the way it is may be more interesting if we require the student to prove that Count Dracula's library has at most two books.

   > In the library of Count Dracula ~~no two books contain exactly the same number of words. The~~ <u>the</u> number of books is greater than the total number of words in all the books. ~~These statements~~ <u>This statement</u> suffice<u>s</u> to determine the content of at least one book in Count Draculaâ€™s library. What is in this book?

2. **I.3** p.21 Partial redundancy?

   The solution to **Exercise 3**  is a partial solution to **Exercise 1**.

3. **I.3** p.21 The phrasing of **Exercise 2** seems a bit unusual. Is it meant to convey the following?
   Prove Proposition 3.8 and show that the ~~given inclusions are, in general, proper.~~ <u>propositions remain valid even when the inclusions are assumed to be proper.</u>
