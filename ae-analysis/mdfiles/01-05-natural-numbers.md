**I.5   The Natural Numbers**

***Exercise 3***

**a)**    $n+1 < 2^n$ is True for $n=2.$ 
Now suppose given condition is True for $n,$ and proceed as follows. 
$(n + 1)+1$ $<$ $2^n + 1$ $<$ $2^n + 2^n$ $=$ $2^{n+1}.$ Hence condition is True for all $n\ge 2.$

**b)**    If $a \ge 3,$ then $a^n > n^2$ is True for $n=0.$ 
Now suppose given condition is True for $n,$ and proceed as follows.
$a^{n+1} > an^2$ $\ge 3n^2$ $= n^2 + n^2 + n^2$ $\ge n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n+1)^2.$  
Here, $n^2 + n^2 + n^2 \ge n^2 + 2n + 1$ is a consequence of $n^2 \ge 2n$ and $n^2 \ge 1$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}.$
