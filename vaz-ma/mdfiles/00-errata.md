## ERRATA



1. p.13 Minor typo in *Example 3*. The phrase in the brackets should be written as:

   > ...(the direct product $\mathbb{R}^2 =\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}_x \times \mathbb{R}_t$ of the spatial axis $\mathbb{R}_x$ and the time axis $\mathbb{R}_t$) into itself... 

   This is because, as apparent from the next paragraph, the ordered pair under consideration is $(x, t)$ rather than $(t, x)$.

2. p.14 Minor typo in *Example 9*. The penultimate sentence of the example should read:

   > ...is called the *translation* or *shift operator*.

3. p.16 The second line of section 1.3.2 should read:

   > ...at the element $x \in X$ is usually called...

4. p.18 Minor typo. The line following the recursive formula should read:

   > This is none other than...

5. p.18 Minor typo. The sentence following the above sentence should read:

   > ...computed at each step becomes...

6. p.20 The last sentence of the 3rd paragraph after Definition 1 should read:

   > ...containing the range of values...

7. p.23 In Exercise 3(a), the symbol $\ne$ should be replaced by $\centernot\implies$ 
   Incidentally, this typo does not exist in the 1st edition, but has been introduced in the 2nd edition.

8.

**OBSERVATIONS**

1. **I.1** p.7 
   The answer to **Exercise 2** remains unchanged if the first sentence is deleted. Although keeping the problem the way it is may be more interesting if we require the student to prove that Count Dracula's library has at most two books.

   > In the library of Count Dracula ~~no two books contain exactly the same number of words. The~~ <u>the</u> number of books is greater than the total number of words in all the books. ~~These statements~~ <u>This statement</u> suffice<u>s</u> to determine the content of at least one book in Count Draculaâ€™s library. What is in this book?

2. **I.3** p.21 Partial redundancy?

   The solution to **Exercise 3**  is a partial solution to **Exercise 1**.

3. **I.3** p.21 The phrasing of **Exercise 2** seems a bit unusual. Is it meant to convey the following?
   Prove Proposition 3.8 and show that the ~~given inclusions are, in general, proper.~~ <u>propositions remain valid even when the inclusions are assumed to be proper.</u> 

4. **I.4** p.28 **Exercise 9** says "(see Example 4.6(a))" but Example 4.6(a) is simply the same statement of Exercise 9, without the words "...show that...". If a reference needs to be made, we may simply state **Exercise 9** as:

   > Prove the claim of Example 4.6(a).
